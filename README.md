**BEWARE**: This is a work in progress, like the book itself.

* Code here may change and disappear without warning. 

* If a piece of code is not yet in the ebook, it's likely to be broken.

* A major reorganization may happen when the last chapter is done. 

* No promises. No guarantees. Use at own risk.
